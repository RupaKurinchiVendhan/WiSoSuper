## Abstract
As the United States constructs additional renewable wind and solar energy power plants, policy makers in charge of operational decision making, scheduling, and resource allocation are faced with challenges introduced by the variability in spatial resolution in solar irradiance and wind speeds. Physics-based short-term forecasting models predict wind speeds and solar irradiance fields at coarse resolutions. Thus, machine learning-based super-resolution methods have been developed to provide higher fidelity for decision making. We present a benchmark of wind and solar data super-resolution methods. In addition to simple interpolation methods, we investigate three machine learning methods: the state-of-the-art physics-informed resolution-enhancing generative adversarial network (PhIREGAN) model, an enhanced deep super-resolution (EDSR) network, and the enhanced super-resolution generative adversarial network (ESRGAN). Additionally, we implement and apply standardized evaluation metrics and climatological data analysis tools which enable an in-depth comparison of simple interpolation techniques and deep learning SR models.
