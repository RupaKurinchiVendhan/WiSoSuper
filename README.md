## Abstract
As the United States is increasingly implementing renewable energy forms such as wind and solar power, the spatial variability of these sources introduces challenges in operational decision making, scheduling, and resource allocation. To address the fact that current forecasting models predict wind speeds and solar irradiance at a coarse resolution, an image-processing technique called super-resolution can be applied to spatially enhance this data.  Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have been applied to SR in recent years, capable of increasing the resolution of coarse 100-km climate data by 50x for wind velocity and 25x for solar irradiance data. To benchmark the accuracy of this model, we investigate three super-resolution models: the state-of-the-art GANs method proposed in 2020, the enhanced deep super-resolution network (EDSR) proposed in 2017, and the enhanced super-resolution generative adversarial network (ESRGAN) proposed in 2018. As expected, all models outperform simple bilinear interpolation on all metrics. Additionally, we found that the EDSR model outperforms the GANs models in terms of accuracy on standard metrics. However, since standard image quality metrics do not account for the high-frequency data that is characteristic of GANs output, both GANs models outperform EDSR in power spectrum analysis, suggesting that we should let GANs models only predict high-frequency features.
